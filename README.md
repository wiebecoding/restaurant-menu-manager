# Resturant Menu Manager

This project was used to learn both MongoDB and React.JS while developing a potential web application for resturants to utilize in order to manage their online presence. 

With this, I hoped to solve the issue of restaurants having inaccurate information up on their website. From my research, I determined that the lack of simplicity caused for an aversion to updating the wesbite with relavant information. 

This project was developed using "Create React App". My learning was suplemented by ["Learn the MERN Stack - Full Tutorial"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) by FreeCodeCamp.org.

## Current Functionality

/ = main menu page to be viewed by public
/menu-add = administrative view to add new items to the menu
/admin-view = administrative view to see all items (including those not shown on the main page) with links to remove and edit menu items.

## Future Functionality

In the future I would like to add...

* Feature to Upload Logo to Website
* Login Page for Administrative Access
* Working Functionality for Editing Items
* Overall Design Improvements
